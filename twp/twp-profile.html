	<h1>Item of the Week: Failed Clippers</h1>

	<h2>Description</h2>
	
	<p>This week's chosen item is a pair of nail clippers. The nail clippers are a reflective silver with a black plastic casing around them. The lever is a dark gray color with a rectangular section for filing nails and squiggly line indents at the end for grip. The nail clippers are a hard object that feel cold and smooth if you touch the metal part and rough if you touch the filing rectangle.</p>
	
		
	<p>I acquired the nail clippers as a gift from my parents because I needed my own set. I have used them for many years now and decided to take them with me to my new room at school as I started another semester at Rutgers. They came along with other tools as part of a nail maintenance set which I regularly used to cut my nails.</p>
	<p>Now broken into several different pieces from an incident that occurred last time I used them, I’m getting rid of them and replacing them with a new pair.</p>

	<h2>Anecdote</h2>
	
	<p>It was a normal morning at my suite on Busch campus. My immediate roommate was home for the weekend, and I wake up relatively early compared to the rest of my suitemates, so everyone was either asleep or not around.</p>
		
	<p>I had been meaning to cut my nails for a few days now but would always forget by the time I made it back to my room each day. Now in my room, with nowhere to be and time to spare, I at some point glanced at my hand and remembered what I had forgotten to do all those days before.</p>
		
	<p>So, I went over to my closet and grabbed my nail clippers, which I kept on the shelf above my hanging clothes. I then walked back over to my desk chair on the opposite side of room so I would have somewhere to sit, which was conveniently located right next to my trash can. </p>
	
	<p>Without hesitation, I proceeded to clip my nails: one finger, two finger, three… SNAP. As I pressed down the clippers on the third finger, they burst into pieces, falling out of my hand and onto the floor.</p>  
	
	<p>I’ve always been told I have strong nails, but I never once thought that they would decide to fight back against a pair of clippers. Maybe they just had enough. I would probably do the same if I spent all that time growing just to be cut short every time.</p>

	<h2>Fun Facts</h2>
	
	<h3>Fact #1</h3>
	
	<p>Before nail clippers were invented in the late 19th century, people used knives or small scissors to cut their nails. (<a href="https://tedium.co/2017/02/07/fingernail-trimming-history/" target="_blank">Tedium</a>)</p>
	
	<h3>Fact #2</h3>
	
	<p>The most common type of modern clippers, compound lever clippers, have a force about 6-10 times the force exerted by your fingers using the same basic physics as a seesaw. (<a href="https://littlemechanic.com/home/english/mechanics-of-nail-clipper/">Little Mechanic</a>)</p>
	
	<h3>Fact #3</h3>
	<p>There have been many different variations of nail clippers over the years including extra long ones that allow for trimming without bending over, ones with built-in trimming catchers, and more recently we’ve seen clippers that run on electric power.
